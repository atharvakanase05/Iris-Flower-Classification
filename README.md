# Iris Flower Classification

This is the task 4 of my data science internship at CodSoft! With CodSoftâ€™s incredible support and guidance, I developed a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica using their sepal and petal measurements. This project enhanced my skills in classification and model evaluation.
